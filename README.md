## Insertion Sort

This is a simple algorithm for sorting vectors using the Insertion Sort method.
A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted list by transferring one element at a time.

The programming language used to build this program was Java.

In comparison to Bubble Sort and Selection Sort (both methods are covered in two repositories in my profile), the Insertion Sort method is the most efficient. Given a list, the current element is inserted into the appropriate position in the list, adjusting it every time a new element is changed. It is similar to arranging the cards in a card game.
